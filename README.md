I am the sum of my experiences. Working in manufacturing taught me the importance of safety, precision, and responsibility. Working in television gave me valuable experience in problem-solving, teamwork, and clear communication. Working in animation created a mindset where I could be more creative and open to new ideas. These skills, experiences, and values will make me successful as I look for entry-level roles in Cybersecurity.
